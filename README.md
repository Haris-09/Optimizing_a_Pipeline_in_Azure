# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**the problem statement:**
- The dataset provided in this project is UCI Bank Marketing Dataset. This dataset contains information about financial and personal details of customers like job, martial status, education, salary, etc. The y colum or the labels indicates whether the customer subscribed to the fixed term deposit or not. This depicts that this is a classifiacation broblem with two classes or a binary classification problem.

- For this problem we used two approaches HyperDrive and AutoML. Finally we compared the performance.

**the solution:**
- Using the HyperDrive i got an accuracy of *0.9144157814871017*
- Using the AutoML the best model is *StandardScalerWrapper LightGBM* which gives an accuracy of *0.90434*

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
